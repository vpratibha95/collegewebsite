    <h1> About TCSC</h1><br>
    <h3> "Education is Human Right with immense power to transform".</h3>
    <h4>-Kofi Anan</h4>
    <p>Thakur Junior College was established in 1992, by the founding members, with the notion of providing an avenue of learning within easy reach to the growing young population of Kandivali and its vicinity. It was a natural augmentation by the Thakur Educational Trust, for the S.S.C. Pass-out students of the various schools as well as Thakur Vidya Mandir. Thakur College had a humble beginning with only 57 students in FYJC first batch of Commerce stream. Its success led to the commencement of the Junior Science stream and the Degree College in 1997 followed by the Post Graduate section in 2002.

        Our college has accomplished a spectacular growth over the last two decades of its journey towards excellence in Education and emerged as a leading Higher Educational Institution in Mumbai.

The College has consistently attained outstanding results in academics at both Degree & Junior levels.</p>
